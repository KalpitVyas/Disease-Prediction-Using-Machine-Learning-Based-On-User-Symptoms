Disease,Description
Drug Reaction,"A drug allergy is the abnormal reaction of your immune system to a medication. Any medication over-the-counter, prescription or herbal is capable of inducing a drug allergy. However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medications. It may cause serious reactions, including a life-threatening condition that affects multiple body systems (anaphylaxis). Drug allergy is not the same as a drug side effect, a known possible reaction listed on a drug label. It is also different from drug toxicity caused by an overdose of medication."
Malaria,"Malaria is a life-threatening disease. It�s typically transmitted through the bite of an infected�Anopheles�mosquito. Infected mosquitoes carry the�Plasmodium�parasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream. Once the parasites are inside your body, they travel to the�liver, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infect�red blood cells. Within 48 to 72 hours, the parasites inside the red blood cells multiply, causing the infected cells to burst open. Malaria is typically found in tropical and subtropical climates where the parasites can live. The�World Health Organization (WHO) source�states that, in 2016, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries."
Allergy,"An allergy is an immune system response to a foreign substance that's not typically harmful to your body.They can include certain foods, pollen, or pet dander. Your immune system's job is to keep you healthy by fighting harmful pathogens."
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn�t produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits at the front of your neck. It releases hormones to help your body regulate and use energy. Your�thyroid�is responsible for providing energy to nearly every organ in your body. It controls functions such as�how your heart beats�and�how your digestive system works. Without the right amount of thyroid hormones, your body�s natural functions begin to slow down. Also called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism affects women more frequently than men. It commonly affects people over the age of 60 years old, but it can begin at any age. It may be discovered through a routine blood test or after symptoms begin. If you�ve recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, it�s important to know that treatment is considered simple, safe, and effective."
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes the rapid buildup of skin cells. This buildup of cells causes scaling on the skin�s surface. Psoriasis is the result of a sped-up skin production process. Typically, skin cells grow deep in the skin and slowly rise to the surface. Eventually, they fall off. The typical life cycle of a skin cell is one month. In people with psoriasis, this production process may occur in just a few days. Because of this, skin cells don�t have time to fall off. This rapid overproduction leads to the buildup of skin cells. Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that forms thick, red, bumpy patches covered with silvery scales. They can pop up anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family."
GERD,"Acid reflux happens when contents from your stomach move up into your esophagus. It�s also called acid regurgitation or gastro esophageal reflux. If you have symptoms of acid reflux more than twice a week, you might have a condition known as GERD. It is a digestive disorder that affects the the ring of muscle between the esophagus and stomach. Many people, including pregnant women, suffer from heartburn or acid indigestion caused by GERD."
Chronic cholestasis,"Cholestasis is a liver disease. It occurs when the flow of bile from your liver is reduced or blocked. Bile is fluid produced by your liver that aids in the digestion of food, especially fats. When bile flow is altered, it can lead to a buildup of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a pigment produced by your liver and excreted from your body via bile."
hepatitis A,"Hepatitis�refers to inflammation of the�liver�caused by exposure to toxins, alcohol misuse, immune diseases, or infection. Viruses cause the majority of cases of hepatitis. Hepatitis A is a type of hepatitis that results from infection by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This is an acute (short-term) type of hepatitis, which usually requires no treatment. This highly contagious form of hepatitis can be spread through contaminated food or water. It generally isn�t serious and usually causes no long-term effects. A hepatitis A infection usually goes away on its own."
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic (long-lasting) joint condition. A joint is where two bones come together. The ends of these bones are covered with protective tissue called cartilage. With OA, this cartilage breaks down, causing the bones within the joint to rub together. OA occurs most often in older people, although it can occur in adults of any age. OA is also called degenerative joint disease, degenerative arthritis, and wear-and-tear arthritis."
(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo,Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is one of the most common causes of vertigo the sudden sensation that you're spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning. BPPV causes brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness.
Hypoglycemia,"Low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia, can be a dangerous condition. Low blood sugar can happen in people with diabetes who take�medications�that increase�insulin�levels in the body. Taking too much medication, skipping meals, eating less than normal, or exercising more than usual can lead to low blood sugar for these individuals. However, for those on these specific medications, a short-term reduction in blood sugar can cause a lot of problems. Your blood sugar is considered low when it drops below 70 mg/dL. Immediate treatment for low blood sugar levels is important to prevent more serious symptoms from developing."
Acne,"Acne vulgaris is the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and/or cysts as a result of obstruction and inflammation of pilosebaceous units (hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous gland). Acne develops on the face and upper trunk. It most often affects adolescents."
Diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn�t make enough insulin or can�t effectively use the insulin it does make. Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs."
Impetigo,"Impetigo is a common and contagious skin infection. Bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus infect the outer layers of skin, called the epidermis. The face, arms, and legs are most often affected. Anyone can get impetigo, but it most commonly affects children, especially those ages 2 to 5. The infection often begins in minor cuts, insect bites, or a rash such as eczema  any place where the skin is broken. But it can also occur on healthy skin. It�s called primary impetigo when it infects healthy skin and secondary impetigo when it occurs in broken skin. It isn�t always easy or necessary to make this distinction. "
Hypertension,"High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when your blood pressure increases to unhealthy levels. Your blood pressure measurement takes into account how much blood is passing through your blood vessels and the amount of resistance the blood meets while the heart is pumping. Narrow arteries increase resistance. The narrower your arteries are, the higher your blood pressure will be. Over the long term, increased pressure can cause health issues, including heart disease. Hypertension is quite common. Hypertension typically develops over the course of several years. Usually, you don�t notice any symptoms. But even without symptoms, high blood pressure can cause damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys. Early detection is important. Regular blood pressure readings can help you and your doctor notice any changes"
Peptic ulcer diseae,"Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a break in the inner lining of the stomach, the first part of the small intestine, or sometimes the lower esophagus. An ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer, while one in the first part of the intestines is a duodenal ulcer. It is a condition in which painful sores or ulcers develop in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum). Normally, a thick layer of mucus protects the stomach lining from the effect of its digestive juices. But many things can reduce this protective layer, allowing stomach acid to damage the tissue."
Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Piles is another term for hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are collections of inflamed tissue in the anal canal. They contain blood vessels, support tissue, muscle, and elastic fibers. Piles are inflamed and swollen collections of tissue in the anal area. They can have a range of sizes, and they may be internal or external. Internal piles are normally located between 2 and 4 centimeters (cm) above the opening of the anus, and they are the more common type. External piles occur on the outside edge of the anus."
Common Cold,"The common cold and the flu may seem very similar at first. They are indeed both respiratory illnesses and can cause similar symptoms. However, different viruses cause these two conditions, and your symptoms will gradually help you differentiate between the two. Both a cold and the flu share a few common symptoms."
Chicken pox,"Chickenpox, also called varicella, is characterized by itchy red blisters that appear all over the body. A virus causes this condition. It often affects children, and was so common it was considered a childhood rite of passage. It�s very rare to have the chickenpox infection more than once. And since the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in the mid-1990s, cases have declined."
Cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis is a common, age-related condition that affects the joints and discs in your cervical spine, which is in your neck. It�s also known as cervical osteoarthritis or neck arthritis. It develops from the wear and tear of cartilage and bones. While it�s largely�the result of age, it can be caused by other factors as well. According to the�Cleveland Clinic, the condition is present in more than 90 percent of people aged 60 and older. Some people who have it never experience symptoms. For others, it can cause�chronic, severe pain�and�stiffness. However, many people who have it are able to conduct normal daily activities."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism, causing unintentional weight loss and a rapid or irregular heartbeat."
Urinary tract infection,"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection from microbes. These are organisms that are too small to be seen without a microscope. Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, but some are caused by fungi and in rare cases by viruses. UTIs are among the most common infections in humans. A UTI can happen anywhere in your urinary tract. Your urinary tract is made up of your kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Most UTIs only involve the urethra and bladder, in the lower tract. However, UTIs can involve the ureters and kidneys, in the upper tract. Although upper tract UTIs are rarer than lower tract UTIs, they�re also usually more severe."
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins, also known as varicose or varicosities, occur when your veins become enlarged, dilated, and overfilled with blood. Varicose veins typically appear swollen and raised, and have a bluish-purple or red color. They are often painful. The condition is very common, especially in women. Around 25 percent of all adults have varicose veins. In most cases, varicose veins appear on the lower legs."
AIDS,"AIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It�s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn�t mean AIDS will develop. HIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of�500 to 1,600�per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below�200�per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS. A person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an�opportunistic infection�or cancer that�s rare in people who don�t have HIV. An opportunistic infection such as�Pneumocystis jiroveci�pneumonia is one that only occurs in a severely immunocompromised person, such as someone with advanced HIV infection (AIDS)."
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"A brain hemorrhage refers to bleeding in the brain. This medical condition is also known as a brain bleed or an intracranial hemorrhage. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. The skull surrounds the brain, and any leaking blood from a hemorrhage can cause compression and damage to the brain tissues. If a blood vessel in the brain leaks or bursts and causes bleeding, a hemorrhagic�stroke�occurs. Compression from excessive bleeding may be so severe that oxygen rich blood is unable to flow to the brain tissue. A lack of oxygen in the brain can lead to swelling, or cerebral�edema. Pooled blood from a bleed can also collect into a mass known as a hematoma. The extra pressure of this can prevent oxygen from reaching brain cells, which can result in their death."
Typhoid,"Typhoid fever is a serious bacterial infection that easily spreads through contaminated water and food. Along with high fever, it can cause abdominal pains headache, and loss of appetite. With treatment, most people make a full recovery. But untreated typhoid can lead to life-threatening complications."
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is one of five types of viral hepatitis. The others are hepatitis A, C, D, and E. Each is a different type of virus, and types B and C are most likely to�become chronic trusted Source. HBV infection can be acute or chronic. Acute hepatitis B causes symptoms to appear quickly in adults. Infants infected at birth rarely develop only acute hepatitis B. Nearly all hepatitis B infections in infants go on to become chronic. Chronic hepatitis B develops slowly. Symptoms may not be noticeable unless complications develop."
Fungal infection,"Fungal infections can affect anyone, and they can appear on several parts of the body. A jock with athlete�s foot, a baby with thrush, and a woman with a vaginal yeast infection are just a few examples. Fungi are microorganisms characterized by a substance in their cell walls called chitin. Other types of fungi, like�aspergillus, can be extremely dangerous and lead to life-threatening diseases. Different types of fungi can cause fungal infections. In some cases, fungi that aren�t typically found on or inside your body can colonize it and cause an infection. In other cases, fungi that are normally present on or inside your body can multiply out of control and cause an infection. Fungal infections can be contagious. They can spread from one person to another. If you develop signs or symptoms of a fungal infection, make an appointment with your doctor."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a disease that causes inflammation and infection of the liver. This condition develops following the transmission of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The most common�hepatitis types�in the United States are hepatitis A, B, and C. Unlike hepatitis A and B, there�s no vaccine for hepatitis C, although efforts to create one are ongoing. Hepatitis C can be either�acute�or�chronic. If you have symptoms of acute hepatitis C, they generally set in quickly and last only a few weeks. Chronic hepatitis C symptoms develop over a period of months or years and may not be apparent at first."
Migraine,"Migraine is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms. It�s frequently characterized by intense, debilitating headaches. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, difficulty speaking, numbness or tingling, and sensitivity to light and sound. Migraines often run in families and affect all ages. The diagnosis of migraine headaches is determined based on clinical history, reported symptoms, and by ruling out other causes. The most common categories of migraine headache are those without aura (previously known as common migraines) and those with aura (previously known as classic migraines). Migraines can begin in childhood or may not occur until early adulthood. Women are more likely than men to have migraines. Family history is one of the most common risk factors for having migraines."
Bronchial Asthma,"Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways to the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities challenging or even impossible. To understand asthma, it�s necessary to understand a little about what happens when you breathe. Normally, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose or mouth and down into your throat and into your airways, eventually making it to your lungs. There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air into your bloodstream. Asthma symptoms occur when the lining of your airways swell and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills the airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through. These conditions can then bring on an asthma �attack,� the coughing and tightness in your chest that�s typical of asthma."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is a diseased, inflammatory condition of the liver caused by heavy alcohol consumption over an extended period of time. It's also aggravated by binge drinking and ongoing alcohol use. If you develop this condition, you must stop drinking alcohol."
Jaundice,"Yellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) by abnormally high blood levels of the bile pigment bilirubin. The yellowing extends to other tissues and body fluids. Jaundice was once called the ""morbus regius"" (the regal disease) in the belief that only the touch of a king could cure it"
Hepatitis E,A rare form of liver inflammation caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV). It is transmitted via food or drink handled by an infected person or through infected water supplies in areas where fecal matter may get into the water. Hepatitis E does not cause chronic liver disease.
Dengue,"Dengue fever is a disease spread by the�Aedes aegypti�mosquito and is caused by one of four dengue viruses. Once you are infected with one of the dengue viruses, you will develop immunity to that virus for the rest of your life. However, you can still be infected with the other three viruses. It is possible to get all four dengue viruses in your lifetime. The viruses that cause dengue fever are related to those that cause yellow fever and West Nile virus infection."
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D, also known as the hepatitis delta virus, is an infection that causes the liver to become inflamed. This swelling can impair liver function and cause long-term liver problems, including liver scarring and cancer. The condition is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). Hepatitis D can be acute or chronic. Acute hepatitis D occurs suddenly and typically causes more severe symptoms. It may go away on its own. If the infection lasts for six months or longer, the condition is known as chronic hepatitis D. The long-term version of the infection develops gradually over time. The virus might be present in the body for several months before symptoms occur. As chronic hepatitis D progresses, the chances of complications increase. There�s currently no cure or vaccine for hepatitis D, but it can be prevented in people who aren�t already infected with hepatitis B. "
Heartattack,"During a heart attack, the blood supply that normally nourishes the heart with oxygen is cut off and the heart muscle begins to die. Some people who are having a heart attack have�warning signs, while others show no signs. A heart attack is a serious medical emergency. Seek immediate medical attention if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms that could signal a heart attack."
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints. It can affect one joint or multiple joints. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis, with different causes and treatment methods. Two of the most common types are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The symptoms of arthritis usually develop over time, but they may also appear suddenly. Arthritis is most commonly seen in adults over the age of 65, but it can also develop in children, teens, and younger adults. Arthritis is more common in women than men and in people who are overweight."
Gastroenteritis,"Viral gastroenteritis is an inflammation of your stomach and intestines caused by one of any number of viruses. Also known as the stomach flu, viral gastroenteritis affects people throughout the world. This highly contagious illness spreads through close contact with people who are infected or through contaminated food or water. It can easily spread in close quarters. Different viruses can cause the illness, each with their own peak season. The most common viruses include norovirus and rotavirus. Most people make a full recovery in two or three days, with no lasting side effects."
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected. About one-quarter of the world's population has a TB infection, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit it. People infected with TB bacteria have a 5�15% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill. "
