# Sympchecker-project
Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning based on User Symptoms. This project was developed by considering the pandemic situation like COVID-19 due to which people were not able to visit hospital, clinics to avoid the spread of the corona virus. This project is helpful for people who are required to take or go under some diagnostics after certain period of time or daily. To get started the user has to enter the symptoms he/she is facing. At the backend are the machine learning algorithms which will show the probability/possibility of having that disease based on user symptoms.
